This is a readme for how to use the card json parser.

Currently the parser only takes tsv files. 
TODO csv files support

This document will cover how to set up the ordering of the input files.
All files' first row (header) must contain `#`,  *type* name, and then the title of any additional fields

`#` represents the number of those cards

The platform inpuus of Projects should match the Specialization inputes of Students

The parser will always check the names column for a line. If the name entry is empty it will skip the line.

#Command Line Arguments
This program supports the following arguments:
-h --help : shows how to use the arguments
-i --input : An input file to parse

 TODO Inplement multiple command line arguments per flag

 TODO Implement output file support

#Formating
This is how the header of different files are formated. 
Each row requires a value for # and name to be considered.
Other required values are notated by a `*`

##Actions
`#`, Action Name, Subtype, Action`*`, Flavor text

Subtype Inputs: Quick Action, Event, Professor, Normal (or anything else)
Action Input: the body of the action card

##Projects
`#`, Project Name, Flavor text, Platform`*`, Size`*`
 
Platforms Input: Desktop, Mobile, Web, Crossplatform (or anything else)
Size Input: Small, Medium, Large

##Students
`#`, Student Name, Specialization`*`, Flavor text, Custom Ability

Specialization Input: Desktop, Mobile, Web, None (or anything else)
For the specializations the code generated will be: 
>*Project Type* commits +2

>Base commit +1

else
>Base commit +2

The custom ability field overrides the text generated by the parser for the specializeation for the body
